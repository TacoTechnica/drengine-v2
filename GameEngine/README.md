# Game Engine

This is a 3D C# Game Engine written by yours truly, designed to run our DR Game.

However, I have moved all generic engine code HERE. This part of the project contains NO DR code. This separation exists for three reasons:

1) So this engine is not limited to DR and can be used for other projects.
2) To simplify the "DR Engine v2" project which now only contains code that is SPECIFIC to DR. Makes development a lot cleaner (and reduces unnecessary recompilation I believe).
3) In the future I might package the game engine as a library that DR Engine uses.

As such this might be moved to a different repo if I decide to use it for anything other than DR.
