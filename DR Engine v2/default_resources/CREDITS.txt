The following lists credits for all assets.
If I fail to correctly give credit for ANY asset let me know so I can fix it right away!

OTHER ASSETS:
    Made by me, the creator of DR Engine.

    You are free to use any uncredited asset made by me.
    DR Engine projects may use all these assets with NO additional credit (since well, they're included in the package!)
    If you want to use these assets outside of DR Engine, that's fine too! But in that case drop
    a credit somewhere or have a link to the DR Engine project.
